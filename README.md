# Introduction
This is the first lab of ESE 5190, the main purpose of this lab is to learn how to use and debug a MCU(RP2040) and a sensor(APDS9960). And we will finish a embedded system which can use an interesting way to display the sensor data.
# 3.2 Firefly
In this part, we will use APDS9960 to track the brightness of the video(https://youtu.be/BtCGtaMrBXQ?t=413). We should make our little LED shine in tune with the firefly in the video. Here is a gif showing the function.
